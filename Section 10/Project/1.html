<!--
t’s clean up time at Camp Whack-a-Doo. The problem
is the campers never know which chores are theirs.
You have been tasked with creating a JavaScript
program to store the campers and assign tasks. The
data should be stored in a map.
When the program starts the user should be
instructed to enter a campers name, and then a task.
The tasks should be limited to the following:
Front Room Sweep
Back Room Sweep
Outside Grounds
Clean Toilet
Clean Sink
Trash Patrol and Supplies
The campers’ names and assignments should be
stored in a map with the task being the key and the
camper’s name the value.
The interface should include a button that, when
clicked lists all the campers names and their cleanup assignments.
