You are, perhaps, familiar with the game Bingo, where
each participant is given a card of numbers broken
into columns labeled B, I, N, G, and O.
You are going to create a BINGO caller program
which automatically calls a game of BINGO. All 
the bingo numbers will be stored in a set called
numbers. For your convenience, you can copy the
code to create the set here:

Your program should have two buttons. The first
button displays a random member of the set to call.
That number should not be called again until the
game is reset. Each time the first button is pressed a
new BINGO number is displayed. The second button,
used when someone calls BINGO, displays all the
numbers that have been called so far for verification
and resets the game allowing you to play again.
