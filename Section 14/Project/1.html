<!--
	Using proper ES6 methods, create a class that
represents a vehicle. Use the pseudo code below to
create the class:
vehicle{
 Properties: color (string),
 direction (integer 0-359),
 currentSpeed (integer),
 topSpeed (integer),
 engineStarted (boolean),

 Methods: accelerate(),
 brake(),
 turnOn(),
 turnOff(),
 turnLeft(),
 turnRight()
}

When coding your class ensure that the value of
direction is only between 0-359 (representing a
compass) in any instance.
Create two subclasses. Create a bus subclass that
includes a property for numberOfSeats and creates
an ambulance subclass that has methods to turn the
siren on and off.
Use text output to the console to describe what is
going on with the vehicle. For example, when the
accelerate() method is used output something
like: “Accelerating. Speed is now 20”.
Create a separate HTML file that instantiates each of
your subclasses and allows you to drive them around
by issuing methods.
