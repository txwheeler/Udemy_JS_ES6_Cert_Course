<!--

The “Lorem Picsum” API sends random images,
similar to the cat API above. It does have a few
more features. You can get a random picture from
the API using the following URL: https://picsum.
photos/200/300/?random.
In the URL 200 represents the width of the image
requested and 300 the height.
For your final project, implement this API using a
promise, however, take the width and height from
data entered by the user in a form. Your interface
should have a field for the user to enter a width, a
field to enter the height and a button that retrieves
and displays a photo of the indicated size.
Once you have this working view the API instructions
at https://picsum.photos/ and add to your form a
checkbox that will request a grayscale image when
checked.
Once you are able to request grayscale or color
images of a specific size and display them, turn in
your code according to the directions below.
